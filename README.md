nvy (pronounced "ehn-vee", like the word "envy") is a simple command line tool for managing multiple env files (profiles) in a project.

- supports exporting to a target file
- supports exporting to a shell
  - note: child processes cannot modify the environment of the parent process, so the `use` command outputs the command text which can be eval'd to set the environment variables, when in shell mode.

## installation üì¶

`cargo install nvy`

## usage ‚öôÔ∏è 

1. `nvy init` - to create a new nvy.yaml file in the current working directory
2. switching profiles
   - shell mode:
     -  `eval "$(nvy use <profile>)"` - to switch between profiles
     - You can add an alias to your shell config to make this easier: `alias nv='eval "$(nvy use $1)"'` 
   - file mode:
     - `nvy export <target-file>` to set the target file to write to
     - `nvy use <profile>` to switch between profiles

note: you can also use `nvy use <profile1> <profile2> ...` to use multiple profiles

## why ü§î

have you ever had multiple configurations with different environment variables that you had to switch between?

rather than tweaking the file by hand, or commenting out code, you can now: 
1. define separate profiles (a .env* file for each)
2. use `nvy` to easily switch between

also, this was an opportunity for me to learn Rust by doing.
